# Kebap Tech - Innovative Solutions for Tomorrow's Challenges

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using Tailwind CSS, Biome, and Bun, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Live Demo

The project is deployed on Vercel and can be viewed at: [https://kebap-nextjs-tailwind.vercel.app/](https://kebap-nextjs-tailwind.vercel.app/)

## Developer

This project is developed by Burak Ünal. You can find more of his work on his GitHub profile: [https://github.com/burakunal28](https://github.com/burakunal28)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
